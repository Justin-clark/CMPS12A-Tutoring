# CMPS12A-Tutoring

I was a private paid tutor for a fellow student taking CMPS12A, Accelerated Programming in Java. These are a couple of the assignments that were assigned that I worked through with the student. I gave instruction on the thinking and problem solving process to assist the student in reaching a solution.
